# Database

## Schema

Database path: `db/shadnet.db`, relative to the executable directory. The `db/` subdirectory is created automatically. Migrations are applied when the database is opened.

### migration

Tracks which schema migrations have been applied.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS migration (
    migration_id UNSIGNED INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    description  TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### account

One row per registered user.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS account (
    user_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    hash        BLOB    NOT NULL,
    salt        BLOB    NOT NULL,
    avatar_url  TEXT    NOT NULL,
    email       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    email_check TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    token       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    reset_token TEXT,
    admin       BOOL    NOT NULL,
    stat_agent  BOOL    NOT NULL,

### friendship

One row per pair of users that have any relationship: a pending request, a confirmed friendship, or a block. The row is deleted entirely when no flags remain on either side.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS friendship (
    user_id_1     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES account(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id_2     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES account(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status_user_1 INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    status_user_2 INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY(user_id_1, user_id_2),
    CHECK(user_id_1 < user_id_2)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS friendship_user1 ON friendship(user_id_1);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS friendship_user2 ON friendship(user_id_2);
```

| Column          | Type    | Notes                                                            |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id_1`     | INTEGER | The lower of the two user IDs, enforced by the `CHECK` constraint |
| `user_id_2`     | INTEGER | The higher of the two user IDs                                   |
| `status_user_1` | INTEGER | Bitmask of `FriendStatus` flags from `user_id_1`'s perspective   |
| `status_user_2` | INTEGER | Bitmask of `FriendStatus` flags from `user_id_2`'s perspective   |

**`FriendStatus` bitmask:**

| Flag      | Value  | Meaning                                         |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Friend`  | `0x01` | This user has sent or accepted a friend request |
| `Blocked` | `0x02` | This user has blocked the other                 |

**Relationship states** (interpreting the two status columns from one user's perspective):

| My flags    | Other's flags | State                                        |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Friend=1`  | `Friend=0`    | I sent a request, pending acceptance          |
| `Friend=0`  | `Friend=1`    | They sent me a request, pending my acceptance |
| `Friend=1`  | `Friend=1`    | Mutual friendship                            |
| `Blocked=1` | any           | I have blocked them                          |

A single row can represent both a block and a pending/confirmed friendship simultaneously (e.g. one user blocks the other after accepting a request), though the `AddFriend` command rejects any row where either side has `Blocked` set.

The `CHECK(user_id_1 < user_id_2)` constraint means there is always exactly one row per pair regardless of who initiated. The DB layer (`GetRelStatus`, `SetRelStatus`) handles the column-order swap transparently so callers never need to think about which column belongs to which user.

### score_table

One row per leaderboard, identified by the combination of `communication_id` and `board_id`. Stores the board configuration. Rows are seeded at startup from `scoreboards.cfg` and can also be created on demand by `RecordScore` and `GetBoardInfos` when no matching row exists.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS score_table (
    communication_id  TEXT    NOT NULL,
    board_id          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rank_limit        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,
    update_mode       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    sort_mode         INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    upload_num_limit  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
    upload_size_limit INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 6000000,
    PRIMARY KEY(communication_id, board_id)
);
```

| Column              | Type    | Notes                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `communication_id`  | TEXT    | 12-character PSN Communication ID, e.g. `NPWR12345_00`                                                          |
| `board_id`          | INTEGER | Board number within the communication ID; games typically use 1, 2, 3…                                          |
| `rank_limit`        | INTEGER | Maximum number of scores in the ranked cache; other database records are retained                                      |
| `update_mode`       | INTEGER | `0` = NORMAL_UPDATE, store equal or better scores; `1` = FORCE_UPDATE, always overwrite                  |
| `sort_mode`         | INTEGER | `0` = DESCENDING, higher score ranks better (most games); `1` = ASCENDING, lower score ranks better (time trials) |
| `upload_num_limit`  | INTEGER | Advertised upload count; not currently enforced                                                                  |
| `upload_size_limit` | INTEGER | Advertised upload size; not currently enforced                                                                            |

### score

One row per (communication_id, board_id, user_id, character_id) combination, a player's stored score for a specific character slot on a specific board.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS score (
    communication_id TEXT    NOT NULL,
    board_id         INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_id          INTEGER NOT NULL,
    character_id     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    score            INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comment          TEXT,
    game_info        BLOB,
    data_id          INTEGER,
    timestamp        INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(communication_id, board_id, user_id, character_id)
);
```

| Column             | Type    | Notes                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `communication_id` | TEXT    | Matches `score_table.communication_id`                                                                        |
| `board_id`         | INTEGER | Matches `score_table.board_id`                                                                                |
| `user_id`          | INTEGER | Account ID; no foreign-key constraint is declared here                                                                                  |
| `character_id`     | INTEGER | Character/slot index; games that don't use multiple characters always use `0`                                 |
| `score`            | INTEGER | The score value; sign and magnitude depend on the game                                                        |
| `comment`          | TEXT    | Optional player-supplied comment submitted with the score; NULL if omitted                                    |
| `game_info`        | BLOB    | Optional small inline game data blob submitted with the score (not the large game data file); NULL if omitted |
| `data_id`          | INTEGER | ID of the associated score-data file in `score_data/`; NULL until `RecordScoreData` is called                 |
| `timestamp`        | INTEGER | PSN timestamp in microseconds since the Common Era epoch (0001-01-01), set at the time of submission          |

**Score lifecycle:**

`RecordScore` inserts or replaces a row depending on `update_mode`. With `NORMAL_UPDATE` the `WHERE excluded.score >= score` (or `<= score` for ASCENDING) clause means the INSERT only takes effect if the new score is equal or better — if not, `numRowsAffected()` returns 0 and the server returns `ScoreNotBest`. An accepted replacement clears any existing score-data attachment.

After a successful `RecordScore`, the client may optionally call `RecordScoreData` to attach a binary blob (replay data, ghost car data, etc.). This writes a file to the `score_data/` directory and sets `data_id` to the file's numeric ID. The `data_id` column stays NULL until that second call is made. `GetScoreData` reads the file back given a player's NP ID.

**Score-data files:**

Large per-score blobs are stored on disk as `score_data/<20-digit-id>.sdt` rather than in SQLite. This avoids bloating the database with multi-megabyte BLOBs. The `data_id` column is the link between a score row and its file. On server startup, any `.sdt` files whose IDs are not referenced by any `data_id` column are deleted as orphans.
